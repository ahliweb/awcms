-- ADR-0036 step 5a — permission catalog seed for the managed-media enforcement
-- endpoint (`GET`/`POST /api/v1/media/enforcement`), wiring up the constants in
-- `media-library/domain/media-permissions.ts` (`MEDIA_ENFORCEMENT_PERMISSIONS`)
-- and this module's own `module.ts` `permissions` declaration.
--
-- Same shape/limitation as every prior permission-seed migration here (see
-- `sql/042`'s header): this extends the global ABAC catalog only. Existing
-- tenants' `owner` role does NOT retroactively gain these — only tenants created
-- after this migration runs get them via the setup-initialize grant
-- (`INSERT INTO awcms_role_permissions ... SELECT ... FROM awcms_permissions`).
--
-- `awcms_permissions` is a GLOBAL catalog (no tenant_id, no RLS — the action
-- VOCABULARY is process-wide; the tenant-scoped grant lives in
-- `awcms_role_permissions`). Idempotent via ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING.
--
-- ## Why a separate activity code from `media`
--
-- `media.*` governs individual media OBJECTS; `enforcement.*` governs a
-- tenant-wide CONTENT POLICY (may content reference media by raw URL at all).
-- Different blast radius, so separately grantable — folding this into
-- `media.create` would hand the policy switch to every editor who uploads images.
--
-- ## Reconciling with sql/053's header — read before adding any media route
--
-- `sql/053` states that `awcms_media_library_tenant_state` has no GENERIC write
-- endpoint and is written only by `markManagedMediaEnforced`. Both remain true
-- after this migration, and the distinction is the whole point:
--
--   * The mechanism `sql/043` rejected as exploitable was the GENERIC
--     `PATCH /api/v1/tenant/modules/{moduleKey}/settings`, gated by the generic
--     `module_management.settings.update` permission that Owner/Admin hold by
--     default for entirely unrelated reasons. A tenant could clear the marker and
--     silently switch its own media validation off.
--   * This endpoint is dedicated, gated by its own dedicated permission, and —
--     decisively — **can only ever turn enforcement ON**. There is no `disable`
--     action here, no "unmark" function in `media-library-tenant-state.ts`, and no
--     code path anywhere that deletes a row from that table.
--
-- So the security property `sql/043`/`sql/053` exist to protect ("a tenant can
-- never switch its own media validation off") is preserved exactly, not weakened.
-- Adding a `disable` action, an "unmark" function, or a DELETE against that table
-- would break it — do not add any of the three.

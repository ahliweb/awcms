/**
 * SoD conflict enforcement at the real `authorizeInTransaction` chokepoint
 * (Issue #181, epic #177 Wave 2 authorization). Ported from awcms-mini
 * (`identity-access/application/high-risk-sod-guard.ts`, Issue #746). Called
 * from `access-guard.ts`'s `authorizeInTransaction` for every
 * `isHighRiskAction` decision, satisfying the acceptance criterion "High-risk
 * action memeriksa conflict pada saat eksekusi, bukan hanya saat assignment"
 * against a real, widely-shared production entrypoint — this is ACTION-TIME
 * enforcement (fail-closed on a detected, un-excepted conflict), distinct from
 * the ASSIGNMENT-TIME evaluation `business-scope-assignment-service.ts` runs.
 *
 * **Base ships NO rules.** `SOD_RULES` is composed from `listModules()`, and
 * the base registry declares no `sodRules` (issue #181 out-of-scope: the base
 * never hardcodes a domain rule) — so in a pure-base deployment this guard is
 * inert (the cheap `SOD_RELEVANT_PERMISSION_KEYS` set is empty, every request
 * short-circuits before any query). A derived application contributes its own
 * rules through `application-registry.ts`, at which point `listModules()` (and
 * therefore `SOD_RULES`) carries them and this guard begins enforcing. The
 * optional `rules` parameter lets a test/composition root inject a rule set
 * (e.g. the in-repo fixture's illustrative rules) to exercise enforcement
 * without editing any base module — production always uses the default
 * `SOD_RULES`.
 *
 * **Both fact sources.** The subject can hold a conflicting permission via an
 * active business-scope assignment's role OR an ordinary RBAC role grant;
 * `resolveSoDAssignmentFacts` merges both (see `business-scope-facts.ts`). The
 * ordinary-RBAC path is the realistic case (a role granting both halves of a
 * conflict) this guard must not be blind to.
 *
 * **Deny-overrides-allow.** Called immediately AFTER an ordinary ABAC decision
 * has ALREADY allowed a high-risk action — this function can only additionally
 * DENY (never upgrades a deny to an allow), consistent with `evaluateAccess`'s
 * own default-deny chain. Every deny/exception outcome is written to the
 * append-only `awcms_sod_conflict_evaluations` decision log.
 *
 * **Bounded cost.** The `SOD_RELEVANT_PERMISSION_KEYS` membership check
 * short-circuits BEFORE any query for the ~99% of requests whose permission
 * key appears in no registered rule — extending this shared chokepoint costs
 * nothing measurable for endpoints this feature does not touch. When it does
 * fire, exactly two SELECTs resolve the subject's facts (bounded, non-N+1).

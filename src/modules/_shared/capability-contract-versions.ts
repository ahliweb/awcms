/**
 * Global capability contract version registry (Issue #741, epic #738
 * `platform-evolution`, Wave 1, ADR-0015).
 *
 * `ModuleCapabilityContract.provides`/`.consumes` (`module-contract.ts`,
 * Issue #681/ADR-0011) name capabilities as plain strings with NO version
 * — sufficient for the in-monolith ports-and-adapters pattern ADR-0011
 * defines, where a source-boundary test
 * (`tests/unit/module-boundary.test.ts`) is enough to keep provider and
 * consumer in sync, because both sides always ship in the same build. A
 * derived repository's compatibility manifest (ADR-0015) needs something
 * ADR-0011 deliberately doesn't: a way to declare "I was written against
 * version X of capability Y" and have that checked against a NEWER base
 * release that might have changed the port's shape — the two sides no
 * longer ship in the same build once a derived repository vendors an
 * older base checkout.
 *
 * This is a FIFTH independent versioning scheme (see `module-
 * contract.ts`'s own `MODULE_CONTRACT_VERSION` doc comment for the first
 * four: package release, REST contract, event contract, module descriptor
 * contract — all ADR-0008/#741 precedent) — one SemVer per capability
 * KEY, bumped only when that capability's own port interface
 * (`_shared/ports/*.ts`) shape changes:
 *
 * - **MAJOR** — the port interface's method signature changes in a
 *   breaking way (parameter removed/retyped, return shape changed).
 * - **MINOR** — a new optional method/field is added to the port
 *   interface, backward-compatible for existing adapters.
 * - **PATCH** — documentation-only clarification.
 *
 * Every capability a BASE module `provides` today is listed here at
 * `1.0.0` — a first declaration (same "not a stability milestone, just
 * the first assigned number" framing `MODULE_CONTRACT_VERSION` documents
 * for itself), not a claim these ports have reached some maturity bar.
 * Adding a new base capability: add one entry here in the SAME PR that
 * adds the `provides` string to the owning module's `module.ts` — this
 * registry is intentionally a flat, hand-maintained map (mirrors
 * `ALLOWED_PUBLIC_OPERATIONS`/`ROUTE_PARITY_EXEMPTIONS` in
 * `scripts/api-spec-check.ts`: one reviewed list everyone sees in the
 * diff, not an implicit convention).
 *
 * A derived repository's OWN capabilities (things it `provides` from its
 * own contributed modules, e.g. the fixture's `example_crm_directory`)
 * are NOT expected to appear here — this registry only versions
 * capabilities the BASE repository provides. A derived repository's
 * compatibility manifest declares versions for its OWN capabilities
 * directly (self-consistency, checked against the manifest's own
 * `capabilities.provides` list) — see
 * `src/modules/module-management/domain/extension-compatibility.ts`.

    // key SUPERSEDES `news_media` (retired): the provider changed AND the port
    // lost a method (`isFullOnlineR2ModeActiveForTenant`), so any consumer pinned
    // to `news_media` must fail loudly rather than silently bind to a port that no
    // longer asks the question it asked.
    //
    // The other content capabilities `public_content`/`social_publishing`
    // (blog_content provides public_content; social_publishing is not ported)
    // remain unlisted — out of scope for this change and, for social_publishing,
    // not owned by any base module yet.

    // and consumed by `seo_distribution` (optional), both shipping in this base,
    // so the port version is honestly declared here. `1.1.0` (not `1.0.0`) is the
    // first assigned number for this base: the port ships with the
    // `summarizePublicResourceFacts` roll-up + `offset`/`order` list options that
    // awcms-micro added as its own 1.1.0 minor, so declaring 1.0.0 would understate
    // the shape a consumer actually binds against. Not a stability milestone.
